# Lesson 0: Setup

## Downloading a Code Editor

* Code editors are where youâ€™ll write your code
* Highly recommend using a code editor over a text editor because they do everything a text editor does in addition to other useful functions, such as:
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Auto-indentation
  * Simple error detection

* Recommended Code Editors:
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)



> #### TO-DO
>
> - Make sure you have a working code editor installed!
