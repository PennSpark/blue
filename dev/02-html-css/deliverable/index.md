# HTML/CSS Deliverable

In this deliverable, we'll create and deploy our own personal website to the internet using HTML, CSS, and Github pages. We have a lot to cover, so letâ€™s get started!

### What is HTML/CSS?

- **HTML**: describes the structure and content of a web page
- **CSS**: describes the formatting and style of a web page



### Table of Contents

1. [HTML](/blue/dev/02-deliverable-html)
2. [CSS](/blue/dev/02-deliverable-css)
3. [Deploying Site with GitHub](/blue/dev/02-deliverable-deploy)



### Resources

I highly recommend the **[w3schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)** and **[w3schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)** tutorials in order to learn HTML & CSS syntax!
